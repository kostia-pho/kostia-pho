### Konstantine Kostia H. Pho

Current PhD student in Linguistcs at York University, in Toronto, CAN, specializing in psycholinguistics, bilingualism and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

I received my Master's degree from York University in 2020, where I worked on building a comprehensive classification system for the Teochew language. Given that the Teochew language is a lesser studied dialect of Chinese, this project was the first of its kind as it aimed to empirically analyze the lexical tone make-up of the language. Studying and documenting the Teochew language has since become a passion project for me and I continue to pursue this research whenever I get the chance.

My current research examines the validity of using pupil dilation as an index for measuring cognitive activation and effort during language processing. In doing so, the secondary goal of this research will be to further our understanding of the cognitive aspect of language processing in a bilingual context.
